## Introduction

Welcome to my Java practice repository! As I progress through Alura's Java courses, I'll be storing all my practice programs and projects in this repository. This serves as a way to track my learning journey and showcase my progress.

## Programs

Here's a list of the programs I've worked on so far:

1. [Guessing Game](Java/Project_B/src/exercise/advinhacao.java) - A simple number guessing game.
2. [Temperature Converter](Java/Project_B/src/exercise/temperatura.java) - Converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
3. [Bank Account](Java/Project_B/src/exercise/ContaBancaria.java) - Simulated bank account operations.

... (more to be added)

## Getting Started

If you're interested in exploring any of the programs, feel free to navigate to the respective directories and check out the source code. Each program will have its own `README.md` file with instructions on how to run and use the program.

## Contributing

While this repository is primarily for my own practice and learning, I appreciate any feedback or suggestions you might have. If you notice any issues, improvements, or would like to discuss any of the programs, please feel free to open an issue or even submit a pull request.

Happy coding!
